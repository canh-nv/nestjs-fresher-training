# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name

Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges

On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License

For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

### Clone dự án

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Build the Docker Image
   In the root directory of the project, run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
 docker-compose up --build
```

This command will use the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to build the image and run the containers.

4. Verify the Docker Image has been created
   Sau khi build xong, bạn có thể kiểm tra image đã được tạo thành công bằng lệnh:

```bash
 docker images
```

5. Run the Docker Container
   Run the following command to start the application in the Docker container, mapping the container's port 4000 to port 4000 on your machine:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 <your-image-name>
```

Replace <your-image-name> with the name of the image you created from the Dockerfile.

6. Verify Docker Image is Working
   To check if the Docker container is running correctly, you can perform some API tests.

6.1 Check by calling the API
You can use a browser, Postman, or curl to send a request to an endpoint in the application.

For example, if you have an API at /auth/register, you can send the request as follows:
Postman: Send a POST request to http://localhost:4000/auth/register.
Curl: Send a POST request to http://localhost:4000/auth/register.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/register -d "your data here"
```

If the application is working correctly, after sending the request, you should receive the following response:
{
"success": true,
}

7. Run in Production Mode
   After the Docker container is up and running, you can use the npm run start:prod command to run the application in production mode (when not using Docker).

   ```bash
   npm run start:prod
   ```

   NOTE:

   Copy .env.example to .env

   Ensure that you have correctly created the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for your project.

   If any API requires authorization (e.g., /auth/register), make sure you have prepared the necessary token or other required information to make the request.
